# README
>This repository is used for studying the thermal conductivity of ThO2 using molecular dynamics methods. 
>The dependence of radiation defects (e.g. Th Frenkel pairs, Antisites and vacancies) on the thermal conductivity in ThO2 is investigated systemically.
>The programming language consists of python and shell.
