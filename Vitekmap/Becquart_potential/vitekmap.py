# a differential displacement vector is defined as x(ij) - X(ij)
# x is the vector difference between atoms i and j in the defect configuration, and X(ij) is the vector difference
# between atoms i and j in the perfect configuration
# The configuration must be periodic in all three directions, so the quadrupole arrangement of dislocations is created
# The periodicity in all directions can also be created by tilting the xz or yz component of the box
